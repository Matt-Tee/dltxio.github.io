# The Philosphy

•	Communicate early and often. Delivering software solutions is often complex and complications can arise. Open and honest communication allows problems to be quickly resolved or mitigated.

•	Invest in future proofing. Solutions should be used and have a long and productive life. Good architecture provides a solid backbone and on-going flexibility to assist with changing requirements.

•	Reputation is everything. Marketing can lift your profile, but endorsement is about satisfied clients.

•	Done means in production. Testing is important, but the real test is user engagement post deployment. Early deployment brings forward ROI.

•	Prefer Open Source. Open source products reduce costs, are generally more secure, and avoid ‘vendor lock-in'.
