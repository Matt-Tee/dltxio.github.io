# The Philosphy

•	Communicate early and often. Delivering software solutions is often complex and complications can arise. Open and honest communication allows problems to be quickly resolved or mitigated.

•	Invest in future proofing. Solutions should be used and have a long and productive life. Good architecture provides a solid backbone and on-going flexibility to assist with changing requirements.

•	Reputation is everything. Marketing can lift your profile, but endorsement is about satisfied clients.

•	Done means in production. Testing is important, but the real test is user engagement post deployment. Early deployment brings forward ROI.

•	Prefer Open Source. Open source products reduce costs, are generally more secure, and avoid ‘vendor lock-in'.

# The Team

•	Collectively we have over 30-years software engineering experience. Check out the Team on LinkedIn.

# The Tech

• DLTx leverages the power of industry-standard programming languages such as C#, Python, NodeJS, React, Swift and more.

• Back-end controllers will usually be written in NodeJS which, simply put, executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
It is an open source and highly performant JavaScript runtime environment used by industry giants such as Netflix, eBay,
Uber and LinkedIn.

• Front-end will be delivered in the modern JavaScript framework “React” (developed by Facebook). React Native is used to
develop native iOS and Android apps in parallel, reducing delivery times and minimizing outlay.

• Digital Ocean is preferred for hosting, providing excellent uptime and pricing structure. Alternatively, the solution can
be deployed on services such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, Heroku.

# The Build

DLTx is a strict Agile software house and encourage participation in the build process. A collaborative approach improves results by reducing waste, assumptions and expense.

•	Work is boxed to two-week Sprints, ensuring all stakeholders can understand the deliverables. A straightforward list of outcomes allows a mutual commitment to delivery by all involved.

•	Deeper understanding of the product is gained through client/stakeholder attendance at the sprint planning meetings where requirements are transformed into discrete, outcome-centric units of work called User Stories.

•	Stakeholders are encouraged to join the daily Stand-up Meetings (usually 10:00AM-10:15AM) either in-person or via ZOOM. Team members share their progress, any potential blockers or concerns. This ceremony allows Project Leads to react immediately and provide developers with product or business information without delay.

•	Jira is a flexible and powerful tool used to track workflow and provide overview via reporting. Team members self-assign work, usually choosing the task best suited to their competencies. Stakeholders are encouraged to use their access to monitor Velocity, Burn Down and other metrics along with the progress of each individual User Story.

# The IP

•	All artefacts, code, scripts, images etc. are delivered at the end of each sprint via GitHub or similar. Not only does this safeguard your investment, it allows immediate and direct collaboration with a Client's in-house or external Dev teams.

•	GitHub (recently acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in stock) is the leading code repository.

•	Terms and conditions secure your IP. Code cannot be re-used elsewhere without express permission and acknowledgement.
