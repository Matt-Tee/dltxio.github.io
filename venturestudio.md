# Venture studio

DLTx are always looking to partner blockchain and payment based startups.  If you are intrested in exploring a joint venture, the below is our typical process.

## Block 0
To begin the process, we start off with a 30min informal Zoom call or office meeting to get to know one another, talk briefly of the idea, assperations and goals, and if the founders visions aligs with ours.

## Block 1
Should we depart with common goals and an apertite to explore a POC or MVP, we ask that you book a 2 to 4hr work shop, with our BA, tech lead and design lead thinkers to explore what the product could look like, and sucess is.  This typically costs $750 including GST.

## Block 2
As an artifact of block 1, we will provide a quote and brief of our understanding of the product, and explore some discounts for equity based on the conversations had to date.  These can veriy from 5% to 49% depending on our evaluation of the oppertunity in the market and the ablity to excute.

## Block 3
The build.  Our typical MVP / POC projects cost $10,000 to $50,000 plus GST.  Our methodolgy and values can be found at https://github.com/dltxio/dltxio.github.io/blob/master/how.md
