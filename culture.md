# DLTx culture

## Team culture
* Be opitionated.
* Work as a team.  Not just say we do, but actually do it.  Pull up a chair, pair program.
* Get it done.
* Collaborate.  Face to face, slack etc.
* Take ownership.  You are part of the business.
* Not just a developer.  Understand that your part of the business too.  Your delivery has an impact on the bussiness, and ultimately your salary.
* We all make mistakes.  Reflect, learn, grow.
* Practice agile.

## Development culture
* Understand done means in production.
* Make PRs, not complaints.  "Rants" are allowed, but will cost $5.
* Tabs not spaces.
* Complete the sprint.
* Raise problems early.
* Pull not push.  Select an issue or task that best fits your capabilities.
