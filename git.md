# Git Process

## Branches

Typical project structure:
* master : The production branched.

## Process
During the sprint, each mesh member is to create a branch with the convention of XX-ID where XX is the Jira Project Key, and ID is the Jira User Story or Issue ID.  

## Pull requests
Once the development task is complete, the mesh member is to create a pull request for at least one other person to approve.  Once approved, that person should delete the branch.
